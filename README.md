# Remarques

Remarques is a Flutter-Firebase based app that provides a note-taking service. The app provides data protection as you store your notes only in your account. Need to remember to pick up some groceries? Need to finish a to-do? Need to write down the due dates of your assignments? Jot them all down in your notes and make sure you never miss a thing.


### Description
The app asks for user signup on the first page. In case you already have an account, you can switch to login and fill in your login credentials. Once successfully logged in, you can find all your notes in one place. You can create, edit and remove these notes anytime you like.
